                <h2>BACK IN TIME</h2><h2 style="color:sandybrown;"> by Thomas Chua</h2>
				<p>		Today’s world revolves around the internet, so people access it for almost whenever they are awake. The Internet has become accessible to privileged people all over the world. However, not everyone can access it.  As we all know, some people can’t access the Internet due to a lot of factors like lack of money and geological location. According to CNN Philippines, only 55 percent of Filipinos have access to the Internet, and only 26% of public schools have access to it. This shows a sad reality that most Filipinos are not as privileged compared to those who can afford to pay for the Internet. People who can access the Internet have benefits to do certain things, and those who cannot will have disadvantages. It is showed that not having access to the Internet is a big problem because everything is happening on the Internet today. Internet is used to spread news, study, and almost all of the things. If one does not have access to it, it will not be updated and lose track of the happenings and updates in the world. This overlooked social problem can be solved by some solutions like banning and demolishing the Internet, and only allowing the Internet to be used by the government and people who will use it to advance our society. These solutions will help benefit our country, and end the problem of unfair availability of the Internet to all.</p>
				<p>		First, electronic devices and social media should be banned and demolished anywhere on the planet. It can only destroy humanity shortly and will make us revolve around it. Banning these distractions and trashes on our country, and even in the whole world, will obligate us to do things in the old manual way. There are tons of benefits that we will get if we start this suggestion as soon as possible.</p>
				<p>		This new world without gadgets will be safer and healthier. Eyesight will increase due to the removal of gadgets. We won’t stare our eyes for almost the whole day on a gadget anymore. People will be healthier because when there is no gadget, they will be doing things manually and won’t rely on the Internet on doing activities. Since most of the crimes are already happening online, crimes will lessen.  Mental health will also improve due to the removal of toxic social media apps that contribute to the increase of mental depression cases. </p>
				<p>Online classes won’t be possible, so studying will be in the old way. Even though we’re facing a pandemic right now, a traditional way of learning will still be possible as long as we don’t believe that there is a virus spreading right now. Ignoring the COVID-19 pandemic will make us feel safe about it. It will benefit those </p>
				<p>		 who can't access the internet because they won’t need to pay a high amount of money just to be in touch and follow the way of the people who can access the Internet. No gadget means no online games and social media for the youth who stays for the whole day scrolling through their timelines and playing online games. No gadgets prevent people to be addicted to online games and social media, so there will be fewer cases of addiction. This will save youth from health risks like obesity because they will do things on their own. Social interaction without using social media will increase. These effects are just some of the benefits humanity will experience if we completely ban the Internet and gadgets all over the world. </p>
				<p>		Another suggestion of what we should do to solve this problem is to suddenly increase the price of accessing the Internet. This increase will lead those who don’t have a lot of money to pay for the internet to do the old way of doing things without the Internet. This will result in a rise in the number of people who can’t access the Internet, so it will be normalized. Furthermore, after some time, the industry of the Internet will fall and eventually vanish because only a few people can pay for it. This will make our society better since we’ll need to do things the old way and experience the benefits mentioned above in the first suggestion.</p>
				<p>		Lastly, the best solution to this problem that I can suggest is to only allow the use of the Internet for those who will use it to advance our society and to use it in implementing laws. A country using the Internet for only government purposes will be better since the government will use the Internet to its maximum. Allowing only the government to use it will make the members of the society to not be careless about using the internet since they will lose access to it. This will also end the problem of the government on stubborn individuals bashing them on the Internet. </p>
				<p>		The Internet is a driving force in today’s world. Our world somehow revolves around the Internet that is why it is unfair if only some can access it. These suggestions don’t need to happen if the higher-ups will effectively solve this social problem. This problem is present for a very long time but is being overlooked and not taken seriously. Accessibility to the Internet is essential these days, especially since we are facing a pandemic, and most of us are studying and working online. I hope that the time will soon come when the Philippine Government will finally have a look at this underlying social issue that most of the Filipinos are affected. The Internet should be available to all, and people should have equal access to it. To conclude, our society is rapidly advancing mostly because of the Internet. It is beneficial as long as it is not abused and used properly. Our future is becoming better and better for every coming day but don’t forget that we should, as a society, reach success altogether with no one left behind.</p>
