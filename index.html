				<p>Today’s world revolves around the internet, so people access it for almost whenever they are awake. The Internet has become accessible to privileged people all over the world. However, not everyone can access it.  As we all know, some people can’t access the Internet due to a lot of factors like lack of money and geological location. According to CNN Philippines, only 55 percent of Filipinos have access to the Internet, and only 26% of public schools have access to it. This shows a sad reality that most Filipinos are not as privileged compared to those who can afford to pay for the Internet. People who can access the Internet have benefits to do certain things, and those who cannot will have disadvantages. It is showed that not having access to the Internet is a big problem because everything is happening on the Internet today. Internet is used to spread news, study, and almost all of the things. If one does not have access to it, it will not be updated and lose track of the happenings and updates in the world. This overlooked social problem can be solved by some solutions like banning and demolishing the Internet, and only allowing the Internet to be used by the government and people who will use it to advance our society. These solutions will help benefit our country, and end the problem of unfair availability of the Internet to all. <a href="content.html"> Click to see more</a></p>
