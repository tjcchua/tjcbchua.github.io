                <h3 style= "color:brown;"> ABOUT THE <h3 style="color: saddlebrown;"> WEBSITE </h3> </h3>
				<p>The Scholar's Eye is an online news website that focuses on the hidden problems of our country, the Philippines. Eyes can be an organ of the body that is used for  vision, but it can also represent knowing and seeing things that are not visible to some.</p> <p>Keeping your eyes open on what is happening in our world is needed these days since a lot of people are actually blind on the reality. Some did not see the inequality and corruption happening now since they don't want to open their eyes on the truth. This online newspaper is available to all scholars that wants to share their views about the Philippines, or even other countries.</p>

				<h3 style= "color:brown;"> ABOUT THE </h3><h3 style="color:saddlebrown;"> AUTHOR </h3>
				<p>Hi, I am Thomas John Carlo Busadre Chua, the creator of this online newspaper website. Some facts about me: I am a Grade 9 scholar of the Philippine Science High School - Central Luzon Campus. I am currently living in the beautiful province of Bulacan, and I am 14 years old. My favorite food are French fries and cakes. Some of my hobbies are: playing online and offline games, binge-watching movies and series, and listening to music. Another thing is that I am currently addicted to reading and watching Harry Potter novels, and I am a big fan of Korean Pop Music.<br> I made this website to show that even though scholars are bombarded by a lot of requirements and are believed to only focus on studying, most of us are eyes wide open on the current issue and problems our country is facing right now. I made the satirical essay "Back In Time,"  which focuses on the Unfair accessibility of the Internet to everyone. I believe that this is an important problem, but is being overlooked since it doesn't gain that much attention. Internet is essential in today's world since most of our activities, like studying and working, are happening online. But if not all have an access to the Internet, what would those who can access do? Just watch those who can access enjoying their life? I believe that the Internet should be accessible to all, poor or rich.  </p>
				<p>Even though this website is not as cool, and beautifully made as others, I believe that I did my best and tried to give and show what I have learned in the First Quarter of Computer Science 3.</p>
